In order to build, you must have the following prerequisites:
 
 * NAnt - .NET build system - http://nant.sourceforge.net
   I use 0.85
 * Microsoft's C++ compiler and linker
   Make sure there are in your PATH (Or just open visual studio, if you have it).
 * Microsoft's C# Compiler
 
The Visual Studio projects are configured to build property if you build the solution (Control + Shift + B).
